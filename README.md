# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Donald-Trump-using-twitter-data
I have collected tweets from twitter by filtering few keywords like trump and donald trump and I have performed sentiment analysis using python libraries.
#This is a sentiment analysis project on twitter data using python.
#I will make you go through step by step process inorder to execute the project.

#1.Install a python environment.we used anaconda distribution and Ipython notebook for implementation.
#2.Create a python 3.5 environment.
#3.Install required python libraries.
#You need the following libraries.
#json,textblob,matplotlib,re,pandas,numpy,array,time,pylab,plotly,datetime
#Run this code iin the terminal>> pip install library-name
#Example: pip install pandas.
#4.I have provided both py and ipynb files.You can use anyone of those format file.
#You can use .py files if you are using any python emulator and if you are using a ipython notebook then you need thos.pynb files.
#5.Execute the collect_data file in the terminal or any python emulator.You can choose the tweets with a particular keyword.See the code.
#It prints all the data from twitter.You then need to make a textfile out of printed data using a command.
#collect_data.py > someFile.txt 
#I have already collected the data and stored it in Trumpdate file. 
#6.The text file contains the twitter data in json format.
#7.Open mining and visualization file.You need to change the text file location in the code.Replace it with the location of the text #file.I have used my filelocation.Please change it.
#8.Execute it and you will get the visualizations of the data.
